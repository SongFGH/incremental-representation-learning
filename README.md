# Dynamic node2vec #
This is the implementation of our algorithms for unsupervised representation learning using random walks for dynamic networks. It includes four different algorithms based on node2vec's second order random walk. Algorithm M1 is our implementation of the vanilla node2vec.

## Features ##
* dynamic algorithms for the node2vec network representation learning
* Corpus generator, i.e., context-target pairs generator.

## Requirements ##
* Scala 2.12 or later.
* Maven 3+
* Java 8+

## Application Options ##
You can run the application using the run_all.sh script file. You need to configure the script file before running your experiments.
